  <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  <p>This is my first web page.</p>

  <h2>My First Project</h2>
  <p>I'm writing this as my first project, hopefully I can learn a lot from this.</p>

  <h3>My Learning Plan</h3>
  <p>My current plan is to learn html and then CSS and then JavaScript.
  <ol></ol>
  <li>...h3 creates a sub heading smaller than h2, and h2
    is smaller than h1.
  <li>...I wonder how small the subheadings can get!
  <li>...<abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> will style the webpage so how it looks doesn't matter too much
    right now.
    </ol>

    <h2>My Second Project</h2>
    <p>For my second project I want to develop my own website that I can use to create study material. <em> I want to
        integrate many services that other websites have to offer onto one interface. </em> </p>
    <p>For example, I want to make a <strong>flashcard</strong> option, I want to make it community specific, and the
      ability to make calls so you can study with your friends. </p>
    <p>Hopefully with this, even if I'm at
    <address>Anaheim, CA 92802</address> <br> I can still study with friends in North Carolina.</p>

    <h2>More on HTML and CSS</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>HTML</dt>
      <dd>I learned HTML because many websites were coded using HTML.</dd>
      <dt>CSS</dt>
      <dd>From what I know so far, CSS is used to control the more visual aspects of the website.</dd>
